Signal is a free and open-source encrypted voice calling and instant messaging application for Android and iOS. It uses end-to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Signal users. Signal can be used to send and receive encrypted instant messages, group messages, attachments and media messages.

## Anonymity

### Tor Browser

Tor Browser is a customized version of Firefox that bounces your web traffic between random nodes in the Tor network. No single node knows both your IP address and the content of your traffic. This helps conceal your true identity from websites, and your browsing habits from your Internet Service Provider. When used correctly, Tor Browser can grant you a high degree of anonymity online.

Download for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html

## Hardened Operating Systems

Proprietary operating systems such as Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows are rife with tracking, security holes, and malware. Below is a list of operating systems that specialize in being secure and privacy-respecting.

### Tails

Tails is a live operating system (meaning that it doesn't install to your computer's hard drive, and forgets everything you do when it retarts) that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. Everything you do on Tails is transparently routed over the Tor network. Tails comes with a variety of FOSS tools that help you keep your privacy intact.
